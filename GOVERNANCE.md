# Governance (Draft)

The Octobay Governance Platform is designed to incentivize contributors and to involve them more in a projects progress.

# Tokens

Octobay has as global governance token and can also launches new ones for individual GitHub organizations on demand.

All governance tokens have an open supply and are brought into existance only through completed bounties. The value of a bounty decides how many governance tokens will be minted.

The Octobay token gets minted for all bounties. An organization's token gets only minted for bounties of that organization. Minted tokens are distributed to the contributor who worked on the bounty, the organization and Octobay.

Governance tokens can be used to flag misbehaving actors or to claim the privilege on a bounty and organizations might set up bounties exclusive for their token holders.

Promotions for bounties through Octobay's social media accounts are also payed in Octobay governance tokens. An organization's governance token gives a discount on promotions for their bounties. The tokens are completely burned.

Governance tokens can also be used to vote for proposals for Octobay or another organization. Proposals are GitHub issues, that do not have a bounty attached. As long as the issue is not closed, token holders can deposit any amount of tokens, to improve the proposal's ranking. Once the organization creates a bounty for that issue, it is deemed accepted and the governance token deposits will be distributed to the proposal author and partially burned.
